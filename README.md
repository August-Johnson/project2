## What is #Goals?

A goal oriented web application where the user can create various goals and save them to their profile. The user can then check back and complete a goal, or decide to give up, and the application tracks their success and fail rates.

## Why use #Goals?

Self-improvement is something many people strive for, and an application like #Goals can assist users in creating a visual representation for the areas in which a user may want to impove upon themselves.

## Features of #Goals

Ultimately, the user can create a list of goals. They can delete said goals, or add more to their list. They can communicate with other #Goals users via a community message board, and see if they made the Champions board, or the Slacker board.
